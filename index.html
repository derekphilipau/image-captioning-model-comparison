    <p>
      <em>Last updated October 2023</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      On September 25, 2023, OpenAI released ChatGPT Vision. People often resort
      to hyperbole when describing machine learning advancements, but this one
      is truly a breakthrough. ChatGPT Vision <em>understands</em> images.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just three months ago, in July, I spent a good deal of time testing image
      captioning models. Cutting-edge models for the time, like Microsoft Azure
      Computer Vision, were able to produce fairly reasonable captions most of
      the time. But ChatGPT Vision blows them all out of the water.

              The image displays an abstract artwork or design. It consists of a
              textured, blue, furry or spiky surface with carved-out patterns
              resembling flower shapes, revealing a beige or light tan color
              underneath. The design contrasts the soft or spiky texture of the
              blue areas with the smooth areas of the carved-out patterns. The
              entire piece is set against a plain white background.

            </p>
            <p>
              The image appears to be a colorful and intricate piece of art. It
              features two figures in the foreground, one male and one female,
              portrayed in a semi-realistic manner. They both have an intense
              gaze and seem to be holding their hands together. The background
              is a vibrant mix of symbols, patterns, and imagery. There's a
              central abstract figure resembling a star or sunburst. Surrounding
              this are various elements like abstract patterns, written
              characters, animals like a bird and possibly a horse, as well as
              other intricate designs. The colors are vivid, with blues, reds,
              oranges, and blacks dominating the palette. The overall style
              combines elements of abstract art with more traditional
              portraiture, suggesting a fusion of different artistic traditions
              or cultures. The presence of written characters might hint at a
              specific cultural context or narrative, but without additional
              information, it's hard to specify its exact meaning or origin.

              Certainly! The image depicts an intricately designed circular
              object, possibly a clock or wheel, with several distinct features:
              At the center, there is a shiny metallic wheel or hubcap with a
              blue tinted reflection. It gives a modern, almost automotive
              appearance. Surrounding this central wheel is a circular border
              that alternates between golden and diamond-like segments,
              resembling a luxurious timepiece or ornamental decoration. Further
              outside, there's an ornate, baroque-style frame adorned with
              vibrant and colorful sculpted flowers, leaves, and swirls. The
              flowers come in various colors like purple, pink, green, and blue.
              The intricate details suggest a craftsmanship of high quality. The
              background is a plain light surface, which makes the ornate
              details of the central object stand out even more. Overall, the
              juxtaposition of the modern central wheel with the traditional
              ornate frame creates a striking and unique visual. It seems to
              blend themes of modernity with classical art.

              pink. The person's face is visible, and they wear a white

              or textile art and a modern element, represented by the soccer
              ball.

            <p>
              Certainly. The image showcases an expansive and vibrant abstract
              painting. The composition is filled with swirling forms and
              colors, blending into one another. There are hints of human-like
              figures interspersed throughout the chaotic and colorful
              landscape, but they are heavily abstracted. The colors are
              predominantly warm, with rich reds, pinks, oranges, and yellows,
              juxtaposed with cooler hues of blue and purple in some areas. The
              brush strokes appear dynamic and energetic, giving the artwork a
              sense of movement and depth. The overall impression is one of
              intense emotion, activity, and possibly a portrayal of human
              interaction or a crowd in a state of flux.

            <p>
              The image features an intricate and highly detailed artwork or
              sculpture. The main structure appears to be a frame, possibly
              resembling a mirror or portal, adorned with various organic and
              abstract elements. These elements include: Long, fibrous tendrils
              hanging from the top and sides, which give a sense of age or
              decay. Multiple eye-like structures protruding outward.
              Tentacle-like structures, reminiscent of marine creatures such as
              an octopus. Shell-like textures and patterns. A spider-like
              creature near the bottom. Other ambiguous and abstract shapes,
              some of which seem to have a glossy or shiny appearance,
              contrasting with the more matte and organic texture of the
              surrounding elements. The color palette is primarily neutral with
              whites, beiges, and browns, but there are also splashes of
              brighter colors like yellow and gold. Overall, the piece evokes
              feelings of mystery, antiquity, and a blending of the natural and
              surreal. The incorporation of various elements suggests a
              connection to the sea, nature, and possibly mythology or folklore.
              The artwork seems to challenge the viewer to interpret its meaning
              and symbolism.

              The image appears to be a dynamic, possibly candid, photograph. It
              captures a figure draped in a flowing, bright yellow garment that
              billows around them, emphasizing their motion. The individual's
              arms are extended outward, and their posture suggests a sense of
              freedom or exuberance. In the background, there's an interesting
              contrast: a tall, skeletal structure that resembles a tower with a
              cloud or a tuft of smoke at its peak. The entire scene seems to be
              in motion, with a blurred effect, indicating swift movement or
              perhaps a deliberate choice by the photographer to convey energy
              and fluidity. To the left, there's a hint of an audience,
              including an individual in a wheelchair and a child, who seem to
              be observing the main figure or an event taking place. The
              atmosphere, combined with the colors and composition, evokes a
              sense of festivity, celebration, or a performance.

              <em>Can you tell me about this image?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Certainly! The image appears to be an artwork depicting an
              interior scene. Here are some key elements: The artwork is
              stylized and uses a combination of realistic and abstract
              elements. The predominant color scheme includes yellows, greens,
              and browns with occasional pops of blue and other colors. The
              space depicted seems to be a room or a series of connected rooms
              with distinctive wooden paneling on the walls. Multiple blank
              frames or possibly paintings with blocked-out colors are scattered
              across the wall, giving the scene a gallery-like feel. There's a
              clear focus on geometric shapes, seen in the checkered flooring,
              the rectangular and square frames on the walls, and the angular
              composition of the room elements. There's a doorway leading to
              another room with a visible interior, which has a green door, and
              inside, there are plants and possibly a mirror reflecting more of
              the space. Furniture pieces like tables, chairs, and decorative
              pots are present. Some of these items are rendered in more detail,
              while others are represented in a more abstract manner. The
              perspective in the artwork seems to be skewed, with a mix of
              isometric and one-point perspectives. This gives the piece a
              dynamic, almost dream-like quality. Overall, the artwork offers an
              intriguing blend of realistic interior design elements with
              abstract, artistic distortions, inviting viewers to explore the
              space and interpret its meaning.
